# 🛣️ OnRoadify – WHERE EX-SHOWROOM MEETS REALITY

OnRoadify is an AI-powered web application designed to simplify the process of finding the exact on-road price of any vehicle — whether it’s a car, bike or scooter. By entering just the ex-showroom price and city, users get a full price breakdown including taxes, registration and insurance — instantly. The app also features an AI Chat Assistant to answer questions about vehicle models, pricing trends and comparisons.
